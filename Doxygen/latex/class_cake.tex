\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Contains all static methods for actions that occur between ordering and serving a cake. 

The suggested implementation is for methods to rely on support from methods in \mbox{\hyperlink{class_core}{Core}}. Note that all methods are static which means there is no need for a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_cake}{Cake()}} constructor.
